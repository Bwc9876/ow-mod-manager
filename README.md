# Outer Wilds Mod Installer

## Development Setup

* Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for `npm`);
* Clone the repo and `cd` to it;
* Install dependencies with `npm install`;
* Start the development app with `npm run start`;
* Restart the app every time you make a change (I'll make this better soon ðŸ¦Š).
